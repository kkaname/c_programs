```

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Master C programming fundamentals
- Complete all exercises from "The C Programming Language" (K&R)
- Solve algorithmic problems to strengthen problem-solving skills
- Write clean, well-documented, and efficient code

## 📚 Topics Covered

### Basic Concepts
- Hello World
- Data types and variables
- Operators (arithmetic, logical, relational)
- Control flow (if-else, loops)

### Number Operations
- Prime number checker
- Prime factorization
- Factorial calculation (iterative & recursive)
- Fibonacci series
- GCD and LCM
- Leap year checker
- Number system conversions (binary ↔ decimal)
- Digit operations (first digit, last digit, digit count)

### Arrays & Strings
- Distinct elements in array
- Counting occurrences
- String comparison (custom implementation)
- Palindrome checker
- Panagram checker
- Matrix transpose

### Pattern Printing
- Square patterns
- Triangle patterns
- Right triangle patterns
- Inverted triangular patterns

### Advanced Topics
- Simple calculator
- Date calculations (which day n days ago)

## 📖 The C Programming Language (K&R)

Currently working through the classic textbook exercises:
- ✅ Chapter 1: A Tutorial Introduction (24 exercises completed)
- ✅ Chapter 2: Types, Operators and Expressions (started)
- ⏳ Remaining chapters in progress

## 🛠️ Compilation

Most programs can be compiled using:
```bash
gcc -o program_name main.c
./program_name
```

**Note:** For `binary_to_decimal`, link the math library:
```bash
gcc -o binary_to_decimal main.c -lm
./binary_to_decimal
```

## 📊 Progress Tracker

- **Total Programs:** 61+ programs
- **Practice Programs:** 33 programs
- **K&R Exercises:** 25 exercises
- **LeetCode Problems:** 1 problem
- **Commits:** 161+ commits

## 🐛 Testing

To test any program:
1. Navigate to the program directory
2. Compile using `gcc`
3. Run the executable
4. Provide input as prompted

## 📝 Code Style

- Clear, descriptive comments explaining program purpose
- Consistent indentation (tabs)
- Meaningful variable names
- Modular functions where appropriate

## 🔄 Recent Updates

- Fixed critical bugs in panagram checker, prime factorization, and GCD functions
- Standardized directory naming conventions
- Corrected typos in comments
- Improved code efficiency and correctness

## 🚀 Future Plans

- [ ] Complete remaining K&R chapters
- [ ] Add more LeetCode problems
- [ ] Implement data structures (linked lists, trees, etc.)
- [ ] Add more algorithmic challenges
- [ ] Include test cases for each program
